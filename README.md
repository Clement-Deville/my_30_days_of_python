# My 30 days in Python

30 days of Python programming challenge is a step-by-step guide to learn the Python programming language in 30 days.

You will find here all my excercises for this Challenge. I am doing it to learn python as i will need it to make scrapping bots in the future and also after for general use.

There you will find directories for each "days" with sometimes notes or comments for educational purpose. I will try to make my code as readable as i can for anyone to read and understand it.

If you have any questions or comment, please feel free to contact me.
